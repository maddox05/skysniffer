A: SkySniffer uses advanced AI for educational analysis. Results are AI-generated and should not be considered definitive scientific conclusions. See our disclaimer below.

A: No. All photos are stored locally on your device. Only the selected image is sent to our AI service for analysis. See our [Privacy Policy](https://maddox05.github.io/skysniffer/privacy.html) for details.
